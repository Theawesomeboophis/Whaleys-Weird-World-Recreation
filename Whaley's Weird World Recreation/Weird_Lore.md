THE GREY PLAGUE

The Grey Plague is a rare disease caused by contact with Greys, if left untreated it can lead to heart attacks, crushing of the spine, spontaneous combustion, vomiting blood, and death. Symptoms include grey skin, loss of hair, strange behavior and extreme weight loss. This disease leads to humans transforming into Greys, other species are effected also. This disease is incurable and highly contagious. Avoid contact with Greys if possible. If infected specimens enter your area, lock your doors and arm yourself. Citizens living in the New England area have claimed they are immune, although these claims are unproven at the current date, please note that although New England residents may possibly be immune to The Grey Plague, this has not stopped infected individuals from migrating to that area.
